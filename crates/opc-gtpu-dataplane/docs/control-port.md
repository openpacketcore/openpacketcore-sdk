# Shared GTP-U control receive queue

`control_port::GtpuControlPort` defines bounded, nonblocking receive and
response operations. The first implementation is the existing Linux IPv4
`GtpuReassemblySocket`. Both its legacy `receive` and new
`try_receive_datagram` consume the **same UDP/2152 queue**. One consumer must
demultiplex that queue; a competing reuse-port listener can steal controls
or reassembled user packets.

Each non-cloneable `GtpuControlDatagram` retains exact received bytes,
length, peer/local tuple and kernel ingress provenance. It reports typed
control, structurally complete G-PDU, unsupported required extension,
unmodelled message, or malformed input. G-PDU framing alone grants no
decapsulation authority: installed-selector and current-generation checks
remain in the existing consumer. Unknown optional extension bytes remain
in the original datagram. Required unknown extensions cannot enter its
G-PDU classification.

| Response plan | Transport and wire behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Echo Response | Reverse the request's exact IP/UDP tuple, retain sequence, emit Recovery zero |
| Unknown-tunnel Error Indication | Caller first establishes absence of a tunnel; copy nonzero triggering TEID, original local destination into Peer Address, and triggering UDP source-port extension; send to peer UDP/2152 |
| Supported Extension Headers Notification | Only a framed request/G-PDU with an unsupported required extension; caller supplies the bounded type list; send to peer UDP/2152 |

These rules come from
[TS 29.281 V18.4.0](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/129200_129299/129281/18.04.00_60/ts_129281v180400p.pdf),
clauses 4.4.2.2, 4.4.3.2, 5.1, 5.2.1, 7.2, 7.3.1 and 8.2.
Encoding and typed procedure validation reuse `opc-proto-gtpu`; this port
does not define a second codec. Receiver-ignored header fields and Recovery
values keep that codec's semantics. No received Recovery value changes a
generation, authorizes restart, or produces another Echo Response.

Planning consumes the receive event. Sending consumes the plan, including
on an error. The socket checks its private instance identity and exact live
local/device binding before sending and rechecks that binding afterward.
An identically addressed replacement socket refuses the old plan. Success
counts UDP payload bytes accepted by the local kernel; it does not prove
peer receipt. There is no automatic reply, retry queue or timeout worker.

Receive capacity is 8–65,507 bytes; truncation of either payload or control
metadata is an error. Per-response policy is a positive byte cap and integer
amplification cap of 1–16. The 16-fold ceiling and codec walk limits of 256
are SDK resource bounds, not 3GPP rate recommendations. The caller chooses
peer admission, an aggregate limiter, supported extension types, and whether
a G-PDU really has no tunnel. Invalid zero, unspecified, multicast or
limited-broadcast response tuples are refused. Directed-broadcast and
deployment-specific admission remain caller policy. Debug/errors contain
only static classes and lengths; packet and deployment values are exposed
only by explicit processing getters.

This increment supplies a shared socket implementation, not a new backend
attachment contract. Linux kernel-GTP private sockets are not exposed by
this change. Live tc classification, kernel/eBPF/mock parity, IPv6, outgoing
Echo requests, per-tunnel End Marker ordering, and installed N3 forwarding
remain tracked by #341 and #790. Existing forwarding capabilities and the
checksum-offload pass-through behavior are unchanged.

Validation uses independently authored packet literals, all 65,536 source
ports at four sequence boundaries, all 255 nonterminal extension types,
all 256 received Recovery values, malformed framing and explicit byte/ratio
boundaries. The independent standard-library Python generator
`tests/fixtures/control_port.py` produces 1,204 receive/response records:
283 controls, 129 G-PDUs, 127 required-extension events, 250 unmodelled
messages and 415 malformed inputs. TSV SHA-256:
`7b474796a8318ec926f931a86c98f535bd207545a01a6ecaa9be7c38698da783`.
CI checks byte-exact regeneration. A separate private-network-namespace UDP peer checks actual
reply bytes/tuples, the single queue, truncation, foreign and replaced socket
plans, and interface-rename refusal. It does not attach a tc program or GTP
netdevice and therefore cannot qualify their behavior. The native runner
requires exactly one executed test, its completion marker and zero ignored
tests. The PR records guard-removal results and public base/head/tree.
