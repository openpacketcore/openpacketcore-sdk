# opc-sqlite-file-control-sys

This private workspace crate exposes the audited SQLite file controls used by
`opc-session-store` to fail closed when an admitted file moves and, on Linux,
to duplicate the exact main, named-database, or WAL/journal descriptor behind
the bundled Unix VFS. The production boundary is limited to
`SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED`, `SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME`,
`SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER`, and `SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER`.

An opt-in test-only feature registers one non-default VFS that rejects unnamed
temporary opens and delegates every named open to the bundled default VFS. It
exists solely to prove snapshot compaction does not rely on a process-global
temporary path.

The crate returns only owned duplicate file descriptors and bounded typed
results. It does not expose SQLite's borrowed handles, paths, file contents, or
a general-purpose FFI surface, and unsupported platforms fail closed.

The crate is source-build only and is not published independently.
